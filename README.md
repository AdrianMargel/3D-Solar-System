# 3D-Solar-System
A simple 3d simulation of the formation of a solar system

The simulation starts with many small micro-planets in a disk around the sun. Overtime these micro-planets merge into larger planets through collisions eventually only leaving a handful of planets in a stable orbit. Obviously this simulation is using a straightforward approach for it's physics and is not scientifically accurate. The density of the planets is also extremely low in order to make them larger and thus easier to see.

The code was written spring 2018
